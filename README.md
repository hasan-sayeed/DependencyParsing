## DependencyParsing

This is a mini-project for class [CS 6957 - NLP with Deep Learning](https://svivek.com/teaching/deep-learning-nlp/fall2023//index.html). In this mini project, a simpler variation of a transition-based dependency parser was implemented. This was proposed by [Chen and Manning [2014]](https://aclanthology.org/D14-1082.pdf).
